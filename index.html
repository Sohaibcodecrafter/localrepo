<p> this is the second repository </p>
<p> to connet the local repository to the github repository we run the comman git remote add origin <link of github repo ></p>
<p> to check branch we use git branch . to change the current master branch to the main branch we use command git </p>
<p>
    then we use git push -u origin main to push our commits in the origin on mian branch .
</p>
<p> process = github repo -> then clone -> change -> add -> commit -> push </p>
<p>
    git checkout <branch name> is used to move from one branch to another
        <br>
        git checkout -b  branchname is used to create a new branch and move to that branch  
        <br>
        git branch -d branchname is used to delete a branch but first we need to move to anoother branch (must not in the same branch to be delete)
